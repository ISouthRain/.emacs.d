RT ax🔥🌸mX<br>This is big! @checkra1n for iOS 14 😍<br><br>If you have an A11 device (iPhone 8 or X), and you want to keep using checkra1n with SEP features like Touch ID, Face ID, or Apple Pay, downgrade to iOS 13.7 now. Apple is still signing it. There is no ETA for A11. <a href="https://twitter.com/checkra1n/status/1308237110047055878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/checkra1n/status/1308237110047055878</a>
